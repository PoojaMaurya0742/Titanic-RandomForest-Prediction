🚢 Titanic Random Forest Prediction

This repository demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a Random Forest Classifier.

📌 Project Overview

During this project, we:

Loaded and explored Titanic train and test datasets

Preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoded categorical features)

Engineered features for better model performance

Trained a Random Forest model

Evaluated model accuracy (~79.88%)

Generated submission-ready predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x 🐍

Pandas 🐼

NumPy 🔢

Scikit-learn 🧠

Seaborn 📊

Matplotlib 📉
