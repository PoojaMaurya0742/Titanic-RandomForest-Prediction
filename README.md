🚀 Usage Instructions

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/PoojaMaurya0742/Titanic-RandomForest-Prediction.git


Navigate to the project folder

cd Titanic-RandomForest-Prediction


Open the notebook
Launch submission-csv.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run all cells
The notebook will:

Load and preprocess the data 🗂️

Handle missing values 🩹

Encode categorical features 🔡

Train a Random Forest model 🌲

Evaluate model performance 📈

Generate the submission file 📝

Submission File
After running all cells, submission.csv will be created in the working directory. This CSV is ready for submission. ✅

📝 Notes

Both train.csv and test.csv are included in the data/ folder.

All preprocessing steps are implemented in the notebook.

This repository is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow.
